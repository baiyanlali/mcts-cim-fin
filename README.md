A way to  quickly set up the website (make sure that Python is installed):

```shell
cd change-this-name-to-your-file-location
python -m http.server
```

We've noticed that the Template we are using will fetch the font from https://xploreqa.ieee.org/xploreAssets/MathJax-274/.
As a result, there may be some errors when starting the website, but they won't affect its functionality.
